This repository contains some of my old Python code, that I wrote at the start of my coding journey.

Current projects in this repository are:

  -A cipher decoder that decodes messages in Morse code, Caesar cipher, Public-key cryptography and Playfair cipher.
  
  -A calculator that solves one equation and recognizes numbers and mathematical symbols separatly. It can add, multiply, rest, divide and rise to the power.
